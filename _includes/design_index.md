# Design Your Authoritative Attribute Exchange Service (AAES)
--------------------------------------

Agencies have a common need to collect and share basic identity data within their organization to support credential issuance, provisioning of user accounts, and access control administration. The Authoritative Attribute Exchange Service (AAES) capability is the means to share authoritative identity attributes within an agency securely. An AAES is a technical solution that gives agencies the ability to connect various authoritative data sources and share identity and other attributes with the shared enterprise infrastructure.

The AAES capability will allow your agency to link the authoritative sources of identity information with customers of identity data across the agency, eliminating the need to redundantly collect identity data at each point where itâ€™s used.
