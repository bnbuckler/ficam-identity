# Integrate Digital Identity Management Processes
---------------------

Agencies collect identity data through a number of disparate processes that are conducted by offices and groups throughout the organization. These include new hire on-boarding, background investigation processing, credentialing, and access control administration. Typically, each of these processes is a manual, separate, and often redundant point for obtaining identity data.

Your agency should seek to streamline and integrate digital identity management processes and minimize the number of collection points for identity data, while reducing or eliminating the use of paper-based forms as identity data collection methods. These improvements are expected to help agencies achieve greater process efficiency and improve the security and privacy around the collection and maintenance of digital identity data.
